        <p>In Atlas of Improbable Places, Travis Elborough goes in search of the obscure and bizarre, the beautiful and arcane. His unique atlas shows you the modern world from surprising new vantage points. It is perhaps the eight wonder of our world that despite modern mapping and satellite photography our planet continues to surprise us. </p>
